I think a lot will depend on what happens with the shareholder vote,\" said Jeff Medford of William Blair & Co.  \nConrail has agreed to a stock and cash transaction with CSX valued at about $8.5 billion. Norfolk Southern, which had already outbid CSX, earlier Friday sweetened its all-cash offer to $10 billion.\nShareholders are considered key to the Conrail-CSX transaction because Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits CSX from buying more than 20 percent of Conrail in a tender offer without their approval. A shareholder meeting is slated for mid-December.  \nSome shareholders have expressed unhappiness with the proposed CSX transaction. Conrail \"won't win the shareholder vote,\" predicted one arbitrager.\nArbitragers, who have been among the most vocal opponents of the Conrail-CSX deal, said that Norfolk Southern would further strengthen its position by aggressively urging  Conrail shareholders to defeat the CSX proposal.\n\"It's got to be like Bob Dole's marathon, but with a more successful conclusion,\" said one, referring to the 96-hour campaign blitz launched by the losing U.S. presidential candidate in the days before this week's election.  \nNorfolk Southern chairman David Goode declined to be specific about the company's plans to woo shareholders.\n\"The numbers in our bid speak for themselves. It should be readily apparent that it's a superior offer. We're willing to talk to all of the constituencies involved, including shareholders and others who are interested in this, and we are doing that,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nConrail has said it will review the new Norfolk Southern offer, but the Philaelphia-based railroad also has defended the CSX transaction as a better strategic match.  \n\"We have high regard for Norfolk Southern and its board, but we simply do not believe that a sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern is in the best interest of Conrail and its constituencies,\" Conrail wrote Norfolk Southern on Thursday before the bid was raised.\nThe new Norfolk Southern bid reflects an 18 percent premium over CSX's plan, which values Conrail at about $93 per share. Norfolk Southern has raised its bid to $110 per share.\nShares of Conrail rose 2-1/4 to 95-1/4 after the new bid.\nWall Street experts said Conrail and CSX, which already revised the terms of their transaction once, may feel pressured again to increase the portion of cash in their deal.

However, the announcement sent AMR stocks tumbling down by almost 5%.\nThe target company, which has not been named, has a national presence, but is much smaller than AMR. The acquisition is expected to boost AMR's market share by several percentage points in this highly competitive industry. Despite the strategic importance of this deal, investors reacted negatively to the news, with the stock price closing at $42.50 yesterday, down from the previous level of $44.70.\nThere are concerns over the market conditions and the sustainability of AMR\u2019s growth. With the pandemic situation in the country, the demand for medical assistance has increased sharply, and several smaller operators in the industry have been struggling to keep up. This acquisition was expected to present an excellent opportunity for AMR to expand its business and capitalize on these market conditions. However, investors are speculating that the move might have been too aggressive, risking over-capacity in a market that might saturate soon.\n\u201cWhile in the short-term, this acquisition might increase the valuations of the companies, in the long-term, the industry\u2019s growth potential might be a cause for concern\u201d said Albert, an analyst from Duke Investment Research. \u201cThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent vaccination rollout have caused a surge in demand in the industry, leading to several companies wanting to join the bandwagon.\u201d\nThe recent loss in the futures market poses more uncertain for the industry. Hospitals and medical centers have not been admitting regular patients regularly, due to the fear of COVID-19, and this temporary pause has hit the industry's growth potential. As we are gradually resuming normal operations, medical institutions might reduce their dependency on a private-hire service like AMR.\nDespite these concerns, the AMR acquisition is still being viewed as a positive long-term development, taking the current scenario into consideration.

The $2.4 billion deal would represent AMR's first major foray into hospital-based care and a significant expansion beyond its core ambulance transportation and 911 response services.\n\nInvestors reacted negatively to the news, concerned that the move into hospital staffing and operations will stretch AMR's capabilities and hurt profitability. The company has struggled in recent years with declining reimbursement rates for ambulance services and rising costs. The acquisition of EmCare is a bold effort to diversify into a new line of business, but also introduces new risks. EmCare operates emergency rooms and staffs doctors and nurses in over 500 hospitals across 40 states. Integrating these new services and employees will require major investments and management attention.  \n\nAMR believes the deal will position the combined company as an integrated emergency care provider, allowing for improved coordination across ambulance transport, emergency rooms, and hospital operations. The companies claim $200 million in potential cost synergies by streamlining staffing, corporate overhead, and healthcare services. However, analysts note the companies have limited overlap currently and benefit claims seem optimistic.  \n\nThe transaction is AMR's largest acquisition in over a decade and follows a leadership transition last year. New CEO Randy Owen has pledged to reinvigorate growth, but the company's stock has dropped nearly 20% since he took over in January. Today's sell-off suggests investors would prefer AMR stick to its core business, or at least expand at a more modest pace.
